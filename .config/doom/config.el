;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" :size 15)
       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" :size 15))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/Documents/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)

;; This is the default tab-width
(setq default-tab-width 4)

;; Set urls to open in a specific browser.
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)

;; Force splits to open on the right
(defun prefer-horizontal-split ()
  (set-variable 'split-height-threshold nil t)
  (set-variable 'split-width-threshold 40 t)) ; make this as low as needed
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'prefer-horizontal-split)

;; Remove quit message
(setq confirm-kill-emacs nil)

;; Python anaconda-mode autocompletion
(require 'company)
(setq company-idle-delay 0.2
      company-minimum-prefix-length 3)

;; Increment number under cursor with C-a, like in vim
(defun increment-number-at-point ()
  (interactive)
  (skip-chars-backward "0-9")
  (or (looking-at "[0-9]+")
      (error "No number at point"))
  (replace-match (number-to-string (1+ (string-to-number (match-string 0))))))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'increment-number-at-point)

;; open info mode in a split
;; (set! :popup "*info*" :align 'right :size 0.5 :select t :autokill t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
